a) The UserController class receives an instance of UserRepository through its constructor via dependency injection. The @Autowired annotation is used to 
indicate that Spring should automatically inject a suitable instance of UserRepository into the UserController when it is instantiated

b) The UserRepository interface extends CrudRepository, which provides a set of standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods for working with the User entity

c) The data is stored in the tables of the configured database. For example we have a table named tbl_user (as defined by @Entity(name = "tbl_user") in the User class), and data from the User entities are stored in this table

d) The rule for ensuring that the "email" field is not empty is defined using the @NotBlank annotation
